This repository demonstrates a common Python coding error: ineffective error handling in data processing. The `bug.py` file shows a function that calculates the average of numbers from a data source. However, the error handling is rudimentary.  The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates more robust error handling.  This example showcases how to improve code reliability by using more specific exception handling, logging, and better error management practices.
